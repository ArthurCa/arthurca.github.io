     <p>I work on several projects like Fixie Lille (Fr), a website about bikes which brings together bike lovers around the world.</p>
      <p class="lead">I've also wrote on several french marketing and tech blogs around the years: Webzeen, Open Linking, Antispam, etc.</p>
      <p>For french speaking people, you can find me on <a title="Merci Sergey site web de Arthur Camberlein" href="https://www.mercisergey.com/" target="_blank">Merci Sergey - SEO tech and Data</a> and for english speaking folks, there is some time on my Instagram account. 2 places where I talk about SEO, automation, Python, R and Internet stuff ;-)</p>
